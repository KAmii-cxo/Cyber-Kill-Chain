## What is the Cyber Kill Chain?

## Overview
The Cyber Kill Chain, developed by Lockheed Martin, is a framework that outlines the steps attackers take during a cyberattack. By breaking an attack into stages—Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command & Control, and Actions on Objectives—it helps defenders detect, analyze, and disrupt threats effectively. For SOC Analysts and Threat Hunters, it’s a roadmap to understanding and stopping adversaries at any point in their attack lifecycle.

## 2. Reconnaissance 
	
- Discovering and information gathering on the system and the victim. This is the planning phase for the attack.
- Open source intelligence (OSINT) is the act of gathering and analysing publicly available data for intelligence purposes.
- Email harvesting is the email gathering process in this stage (theHarvester, Hunter.io)
